This is what the voice will speak word-for-word. Must be at least 5 words. Max 30,000 characters (enough for a 20-minute video at normal voice speed). The AI automatically splits it into visual segments and generates matching visuals.\n\n**Visual control:** By default, the AI decides what visuals to show for each part of your narration. For more control, add visual instructions in brackets before each narration segment:\n\n`[A dark forest at night] The wind howled through the trees. [Glowing eyes peering from shadows] Something was watching.`\n\nEach `[bracketed text]` tells the AI exactly what to show for that scene. The text after it is the voiceover.\n\n**Put a real person, product, or place in the video (@mentions):** reference a saved element by its handle, e.g. `[@Dhiva holding @Red-Bottle] Meet the founder who started it all.` The element's reference photo is fed to the image model so the same face or product appears consistently across the whole video. Get handles from `GET /elements`; create new elements with `POST /elements`. Rules: works with `mediaType` `images` (needs `imageQuality` `good` or higher) and `video`; not with `stock`. The photo decides how the element looks; never describe its appearance in the script. Mentions are spoken as the plain name (the `@` is never read aloud), and unknown handles are treated as plain words.\n\n**Idea mode** (`inputType: \"idea\"`): Provide a short topic or concept. The AI writes a full narration script for you. Keep it under 800 characters. Pair with `expectedDurationSeconds` to control video length.\n\nSupports any language.

Example script: `\"A robot learns what friendship means on its first day at school\"`.\n\n**Important:** When you set a template, it automatically handles `mediaType` and visual settings for you. You do not need to set `mediaType`, `imageQuality`, or `imageStyleId` separately. Just provide your `script` (or `inputType: \"idea\"` with a topic) and the template takes care of the rest.\n\nFor talking-head avatar videos, do NOT use a template: set `mediaType: \"avatar\"` with an `avatarId` instead."
